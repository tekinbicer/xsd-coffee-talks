      <description>Abstract We apply artificial intelligence techniques to advance X-ray tomography imaging experiments at synchrotron light sources, in both post processing and online (or near real-time streaming) processing scenarios. We also explore its applicability in practical experiment configurations, for example in scenarios in which a deep learning model is trained on a supercomputer but executed for inference on an edge computing device (e.g., Google edge TPU, NVIDIA Jetson). Specifically, we share three aspects of deep learning for X-ray tomography in this talks: (1) TomoGAN, a denoising technique based on generative adversarial networks, for improving the quality of reconstructed images in low-dose imaging conditions.</description>
