      <description>Abstract Exponential increases in data volumes and velocities are overwhelming finite human capabilities. Continued progress in science and engineering demands that we automate a broad spectrum of currently manual research data manipulation tasks, from data transfer and sharing to acquisition, publication, and analysis. These needs are particularly evident in large-scale experimental science, in which researchers are typically granted short periods of instrument time and must maximize experiment efficiency as well as output data quality and accuracy.</description>
