      <description>Abstract Ptychography is a scanning coherent diffractive imaging technique that recovers the phase of a sample’s projection using phase-retrieval algorithm. Ptychography applied in a computed tomography setting has been able to provide a reconstruction with sub-20 nm resolution representing the sample’s refractive indices. Conventionally, to achieve the highest resolution of retrieved projections and tomographic reconstruction the technique relies on object’s dense lateral (scanning) and angular (rotational) sampling, respectively. However, such an approach comes with a cost of long acquisition time, large amount of collected data, and higher computational complexity required for the reconstruction.</description>
