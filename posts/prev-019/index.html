<p>In laser welding, machining, and 3D printing of metals, incandescent droplets are frequently ejected from the laser’s path. This phenomenon is commonly known as spattering. Although these fireworks-like sparks are strikingly beautiful, they can cause structural defects—rough surfaces, craters, and porosity—resulting in the degradation of material properties. For years, researchers have been trying to understand the origins of spattering by doing fast optical imaging experiments. But, limited by their penetration power, visible light and infrared imaging could not capture the subsurface structural dynamics. Therefore, many key processes that lead to the initial formation of spatters have never been directly observed, and the occurrence of those extremely fast spatters still lacks affirmatory explanation. Here, we use ultrahigh-speed synchrotron-x-ray-based full-field imaging to probe the spattering process. We elucidate the major forces involved in different stages of spattering and identify the substantial role of melt and vapor flow in this process. More importantly, we discover that the explosion of some unusual protrusions arising from the front keyhole wall drives the initial escape of molten metal around the keyhole rims and the subsequent ejection of fast spatters. Our study advances the fundamental understanding of the laser-induced spattering phenomenon and paves the way for manufacturing defect-free metal parts via the control of keyhole dynamics.</p>

<p>Dr. Cang Zhao is now a postdoc at Argonne National Laboratory, working on monitoring microstructural evolution during metal additive manufacturing processes. He received his Ph.D. degree in Structural Engineering from the University of California, San Diego in 2015, his master’s degree in Condensed Matter Physics from the University of Science and Technology of China in 2011, and his bachelor’s degree in Materials Science and Engineering from the University of Science and Technology Beijing in 2009. A few keywords could be used to summarize his research: metal additive manufacturing, cellular solids, and multiscale mechanics. Through his academic studies so far, he has published more than 20 articles in peer-reviewed journals, including Science, Physical Review X, Physical Review Letters, Nanoscale, and Acta Materialia, and has achieved the Outstanding Postdoctoral Performance Award in Applied Science from the Argonne National Laboratory, the President Award of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, and the Outstanding Graduate of Beijing City.</p>
